# angular_todo
Was for an interview - extended to learn more about Spring Boot, Angular 1.5, AWS.

After the initial clone, cd into angular1.5 and perform an "npm install".

The the normal build process is (from the root directory): "ant".

The result is a jar file (todo-spring-boot-server-X-X-X.jar) that may be executed by any java 8 VM.

Server listens on port 8080. Username is demo, password is password.
